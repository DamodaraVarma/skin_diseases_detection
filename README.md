# 🩺 Skin Diseases Detection using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to **detect and classify skin diseases** using **deep learning (CNN/YOLO/ResNet models)**.
It helps in early identification of skin-related issues by analyzing uploaded/captured images and predicting the most probable disease.

---

## ⚡ Features

* Upload or capture skin images for analysis.
* Classifies multiple skin disease types (e.g., eczema, psoriasis, acne, melanoma, etc.).
* Provides prediction confidence score.
* Simple user interface (CLI/Flask/Django, depending on implementation).

---

## 🛠 Requirements

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras torch torchvision opencv-python numpy matplotlib flask
```

*(Adjust the list depending on your framework: TensorFlow / PyTorch / YOLO.)*

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone or copy the project folder to `C:\skin_diseases_detection`.
2. Train the model (if not already trained):

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. Run the app (Flask example):

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open browser at **[http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)** to upload/test images.

---

## 🎯 Dataset

* Publicly available skin disease datasets (e.g., **HAM10000**, **ISIC**) can be used.
* Images should be preprocessed (resized, normalized) before training.

---

## 📌 Notes

* Accuracy depends on dataset size and model architecture.
* YOLOv8 or CNN (ResNet50, VGG16) can be used for better performance.
* For real-world use, **medical validation is required**.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add **multi-disease detection** per image.
* Deploy model as a **mobile app** for offline use.
* Integrate explainable AI (heatmaps to show affected regions).
